# Traffic Service
This includes development notes on the technical implementation of the Traffic Service.

## Technical Implementation
The following includes some technical notes on the implementation, including aspects which might be improved or expanded on in the future.

### TrafficServiceType

`TrafficServiceType` is an enumeration of the different types of traffic services that can be used in the Emulator. If a new traffic service is added, this enumeration should be updated to include the new traffic service type.

### TrafficService

Based on the `service_type` parameter, the `TrafficService.install` method creates an instance of the appropriate traffic server. The traffic server can be an instance of either a `TrafficGenerator` or a `TrafficReceiver`. If a new traffic server is added, the `TrafficService.install` method should be updated to create an instance of the new traffic server.

### TrafficGenerator

The `TrafficGenerator` class is the base class for all traffic generators.
If a new traffic generator is added, it should be a subclass of the `TrafficGenerator` class.

`TrafficGenerator` class provides the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the traffic generator with the following parameters.

  - `name`: The virtual node name for the traffic generator. It is used to configure the custom domain name for the underlying host.
  - `log_file`: The log file where the traffic generation logs will be stored.
  - `protocol`: The protocol to be used for traffic generation.
  - `duration`: The duration of the traffic generation process.
  - `rate`: The rate of the traffic generation process.
  - `extra_options`: The extra options to be used for the traffic generation process. This parameter value depends on the type of traffic generator being used.
- `addReceivers`: Adds traffic receiver host addresses to a traffic generator so that the traffic generator can send traffic to the specified hosts. We can specify the list of receiver hosts for the traffic generator using the `hosts` parameter.
- `install`: Installs the traffic generator application on the host. It creates `/root/traffic-targets` file on the host to store the list of receiver hosts. Any subclass of the `TrafficGenerator` class should implement the `install` method to install necessary packages for the traffic generator application.

- `start`: Starts the traffic generation process on the host.

## Traffic Receiver

The `TrafficReceiver` class is the base class for all traffic receivers. Any new traffic receiver be a subclass of the `TrafficReceiver` class.

`TrafficReceiver` class provides the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the traffic receiver with the following parameters.

  - `name`: The virtual node name for the traffic receiver. It is used to configure the custom domain name for the underlying host.
  - `log_file`: The log file where the traffic receiver logs will be stored.
- `install`: Installs the traffic receiver application on the host.  Any subclass of the `TrafficReceiver` class should implement the `install` method to install necessary packages for the traffic receiver application.
